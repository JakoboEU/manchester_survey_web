        <h2>What this study is about</h2>
        <p>
        This survey asks people to compare photos of greenspaces and choose which seems better for biodiversity, feels safer, or is more economically desirable. Results will be compared with ecological indicators from our fieldwork to inform greenspace planning in Manchester.
        </p>
        <h2>What we collect (and what we don’t)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Collected: A/B choices for three questions and minimal demographics (e.g., broad age band, borough/area, simple gender option).</li>
            <li>Not collected: Names, emails, phone numbers, precise addresses/postcodes, IP addresses in the research tables, free-text responses, or any special-category/sensitive data.</li>
            <li>Your responses are anonymous by design. We cannot identify you from the data we collect.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How we use and share data</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Data are analysed to understand how preferences vary across demographic groups.</li>
            <li>Only aggregated results by demographic groups are shared or published. We do not share row-level data that include demographics.</li>
            <li>Findings may be published in academic journals and reports; no individual-level data will be released.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Lawful basis and your rights</h2>
        <p>Because the survey is anonymous, UK data protection law generally does not apply to these research data and rights such as access/erasure typically do not apply. If you contact us and provide additional information that could enable identification, we will consider your request insofar as legally required. You may exit the survey at any time before submitting.</p>
        <h2>Storage, security, and transfers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Front end: Static webpages hosted from GitHub, communicating with the database over HTTPS.</li>
            <li>Database: Supabase (managed Postgres) with encryption at rest, role-based access, and row-level security.</li>
            <li>Exports: After the survey closes, datasets are exported to CSV and stored in a secured individual Dropbox account with 2-factor authentication.</li>
            <li>We implement least-privilege access, key rotation, and audit checks. Infrastructure providers may process limited technical logs (e.g., for security); these are not used for research.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Location of processing</h2>
        <p>Data are stored in [UK/EU region where configured]. If any processing occurs outside the UK/EU, appropriate safeguards will be applied.</p>
        <h2>Retention</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Raw, pseudonymised research datasets: retained for 5 years for verification and audit, then securely deleted.</li>
            <li>Aggregated analyses and code: may be retained/published indefinitely.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Voluntary participation and age</h2>
        <p>Participation is voluntary. You must be 18 or over to take part.</p>
